# Homelable Features

Here's what Homelable can do. One line on what each feature is, then how to switch it on and use it.

> **Two modes.** Same UI, two ways to run it:
> - **Full mode**, with the backend (Docker/LXC). Everything works.
> - **Standalone mode** (`VITE_STANDALONE=true`), no backend, canvas lives in your browser's `localStorage`. Great for just drawing; anything that needs a server (scanning, imports, device inventory, floor-plan upload, live view) is hidden.
>
> Features marked 🔒 need Full mode.

## 1. Zones

**What:** Labeled boxes to group devices by area: "Living room", "Rack 1", "DMZ", whatever makes sense to you.

**Use:**
- Sidebar → **Add Zone**. Give it a title and a color, then drag it around and resize it.
- Drop nodes onto a zone and Homelable asks if you want to add them to it.
- Zones sit behind your nodes and move on their own. They're just there to keep things tidy.

---

## 2. Groups & Nesting

**What:** Some devices hold others, like a **Proxmox** host with its **VMs** and **LXCs** inside. Those show up as an expandable container.

**Use:**
- Drag a `vm` or `lxc` onto a `proxmox` node, confirm **Add to container**, and it becomes a child.
- Click the container header to fold it open or shut; it resizes itself around what's inside.
- The Zigbee and Z-Wave imports build the same kind of hierarchy for you (coordinator → routers → end devices).

---

## 3. Text Annotations

**What:** Loose text labels for notes, section titles, or anything you want to call out on the canvas.

**Use:** Sidebar → **Add Text**, type, drop it where you want, style it.

---

## 4. Multiple Canvases

**What:** More than one diagram in a single install, say "Network", "Home automation", "Rack layout", each with its own nodes, links, floor plan, and style.

**Use:**
- The **canvas switcher** is at the top of the sidebar. Click to jump between canvases, or **New Canvas** to start a fresh one.
- Hover a canvas to **Edit** it (name, icon, floor plan) or **Delete** it. You can't delete the last one.
- Each canvas saves on its own, so hit **Save Canvas** after you change something.

---

## 5. Rack Canvas

**What:** The physical side of the lab, as its own kind of canvas: racks, the gear mounted in them, and the patch cables between their ports. Where a diagram says what talks to what, a rack says what sits in which U, and which switch port the uplink lands on.

**Use:**
- **Canvas switcher** → **New Canvas** → Kind **Rack**. A canvas cannot change kind afterwards.
- **Add Rack** in the header drops a rack; double-click its frame for U height, 19"/10" width, numbering direction, colours and the enclosed/open look.
- **+ Device** in the sidebar mounts something: an entry from your **Device Inventory** 🔒, a **new device** (which joins the inventory tagged *Rack devices*), or a rack-only **accessory** (blank, shelf, cable manager). Double-click a plate to edit it, and **Unmount** to take it out — the device itself stays in the inventory.
- Gear occupies a U range and part of a 12-column width grid, so half- and third-width machines share a U. A drop snaps to the nearest free slot, an impossible one previews red, and growing a device relocates it to the nearest slot that fits.
- The **Faceplate** field opens a visual catalog — servers, switches, routers, patch panels, UPS and PDUs, desktop NAS towers, shelves and blanks — drawn as vector artwork that scales with the rack and follows your theme.
- **Patch**: drag from one port to another (or click both in turn) to cable them, across racks if you need to. Click a cable to select it, then **Delete** or **Unplug**. A header select controls whether cables show on hover, always, or not at all.
- **Status**: pin a mount's colour, or set **Check device** 🔒 so it follows the status check already configured on the matching diagram node.
- **Import links** 🔒 derives patches from the physical links already drawn on your diagrams. Run it again after racking more gear — pairs already cabled are left alone.
- Saving is explicit — **Save Rack** — like any other canvas.

## 6. Customize Style

**What:** Repaint the whole thing with a preset theme, or roll your own node and edge colors.

**Use:**
- Toolbar → **Style**. Pick a preset: **Default**, **Dark**, **Light**, **Neon**, or **Matrix**.
- Or pick **Custom** and hit its **Edit** button to set border/background colors per node type and link colors per edge type.
- Theme and custom colors are saved **per canvas** on your next **Save Canvas**.

---

## 7. Floor Plan 🔒

**What:** Put a background image (a house plan, an office layout, a rack diagram) behind a canvas and lay your devices out on top of it.

**Use:**
- Open the **canvas switcher** → **Edit** the active canvas (or double-click the floor plan already on the canvas).
- In the **Floor Plan** section, upload an image and set its size and lock state.
- The image lives on the backend and is loaded by URL, never baked into the canvas, so your canvases stay light. *(See ADR-001; floor plans are Full mode only.)*

---

## 8. Network Scanner (IP import) 🔒

**What:** Point `nmap` at your network, fingerprint the services it finds, and turn hosts into nodes.

**Use:**
1. Sidebar → **Scan Network**. Scan History opens and keeps refreshing until it's done.
2. Set the CIDR ranges you want in `SCANNER_RANGES` (`.env`), or override them per scan in the dialog.
3. Whatever it finds shows up in the **Device Inventory** (below) to approve, hide, or ignore.

**Deep scan (custom ports):** to catch services on odd ports, add them in `.env`:
```env
SCANNER_HTTP_RANGES=["8080","9000-9100"]
SCANNER_HTTP_PROBE_ENABLED=true
SCANNER_HTTP_VERIFY_TLS=false
```

**Root note:** SYN scans and OS detection need root. If a scan trips on permissions, run `scripts/run_scan.py` with `sudo`, or on Linux give nmap the `NET_RAW` capability. Full details in the [README](./README.md#network-scanner).

---

## 9. Zigbee Import 🔒

**What:** Pull your **Zigbee2MQTT** topology in over MQTT and drop every device on the canvas as a typed node.

**Use:**
1. Sidebar → **Zigbee Import**.
2. Enter broker host/port (default `1883`), any credentials, and the base topic (default `zigbee2mqtt`).
3. **Test Connection** → **Fetch Devices** → pick from the grouped list → **Add N to Canvas**.

Nodes come in as `zigbee_coordinator` / `zigbee_router` / `zigbee_enddevice`. The hierarchy (coordinator → routers → end devices) and **LQI** are filled in automatically. More: [docs/zigbee-import.md](./docs/zigbee-import.md).

---

## 10. Z-Wave Import 🔒

**What:** Same idea for **Z-Wave JS UI**, over the same MQTT broker.

**Use:**
1. Sidebar → **Z-Wave Import**.
2. Enter broker host/port, any credentials, the MQTT prefix (default `zwave`), and the gateway name (default `zwavejs2mqtt`).
3. **Test Connection** → send them to **Pending** or straight to the **Canvas** → import → pick devices → **Add N to Canvas**.

Nodes: `zwave_coordinator` / `zwave_router` / `zwave_enddevice`. The hierarchy comes from each node's neighbor list (Z-Wave has no LQI). More: [docs/zwave-import.md](./docs/zwave-import.md).

---

## 11. Proxmox VE Import 🔒

**What:** Pull your **Proxmox VE** inventory (hosts, VMs, LXC) in over the Proxmox REST API — typed, named nodes with run state and hardware specs. Optional scheduled **auto-sync**; guest IPs already found by a scan are merged, not duplicated.

**Use:**
1. Create a read-only API token in Proxmox (Datacenter → Permissions → API Tokens, role `PVEAuditor`).
2. Sidebar → **Proxmox Import**.
3. Enter host, port (default `8006`), and the token (`user@realm!tokenid` + secret) — or leave blank to use the server token.
4. **Test Connection** → send to **Pending** or the **Canvas** → import → pick devices → **Add N to Canvas**.

Nodes: `proxmox` (host) / `vm` / `lxc`, linked host→guest by a `virtual` edge. The token is env-only, never stored on disk, never returned by the API. Enable auto-sync from **Settings** once `PROXMOX_TOKEN_ID` / `PROXMOX_TOKEN_SECRET` are set. More: [docs/proxmox-import.md](./docs/proxmox-import.md).

---

## 12. Device Inventory 🔒

**What:** The holding pen for everything found by a scan or import that isn't on the canvas yet, plus a separate **Hidden Devices** list.

**Use:**
- Sidebar → **Device Inventory**. Each entry shows IP, MAC, hostname, and any OS and services detected.
- Per device: **Approve** to drop a typed node on the canvas, **Hide** to stash it (you can get it back), or **Ignore** to dismiss it.
- **Hidden Devices** is the sidebar entry where you review and restore anything you've hidden.

---

## 13. Documentation 🔒

**What:** A markdown documentation space for the whole lab. Every device gets a document written once from what the scan actually found — identity, hardware, services, network, operations, troubleshooting — and it is yours from there; nothing rewrites it behind you. Next to it, a Library of pages you write yourself: runbooks, incidents, decisions, a network overview.

**Use:**
- Sidebar → **Documentation**. The **Devices** root re-pivots instantly by zone, group, type, physical/virtual, subnet, rack, vendor, discovery source, status, tag or A–Z; picking a device with no document writes one from its facts.
- The **Library** is folders you make. **New page** / **New folder** in the header, drag an item to file it. Templates: blank, runbook, service, network overview, incident, procedure, decision (ADR), zone.
- Editing is plain markdown and **saving is explicit**, like the canvas. An unsaved body is kept in your browser and offered back if you close the tab. `/` in the editor inserts a freshly generated block — services, hardware, network, rack — from the device's current data.
- **Link documents** with `[[VLAN plan]]`, `[[device:nas-01]]` or `[[doc:slug|label]]`. Typing `[[` opens a picker that writes the link for you. A link to a document that does not exist yet renders red and offers to create it, and every document lists **Linked from** at the bottom — who points here.
- **History**: the clock-arrow button in the header lists earlier versions, up to 50 per document. Read one, hit **Changes** for a line-by-line diff against the current body, **Restore** to bring it back — the body it replaces is saved to the history first.
- **Keeping it honest**: `review_every: 6m` in a document's frontmatter badges it "due for review" when it lapses; a **device data changed** banner appears when the device has moved on since the document was written; **Regenerate** rebuilds a device document from scratch (old body kept in the history). Tags are chips under the title.
- **Search** the whole space from the box above the tree — title, tags and body. The canvas' own search (Ctrl/Cmd+K) finds documents too, and picking one jumps here.
- Coming from the old per-device **Notes** field? A banner offers to migrate every device that has one into a document. It copies, it does not move: the `notes` field is left exactly as it was.

## 14. Live Status Monitoring 🔒

**What:** Keeps checking each node and shows its status (🟢 online / 🔴 offline / ⚫ unknown) right on the canvas.

**Use:**
- Pick a **check method** per node when you add or edit it:

  | Method | Checks |
  |--------|--------|
  | `ping` | ICMP reachability |
  | `nmap` | `nmap -sn` host discovery — ARP on the local segment, catching ICMP-filtered devices. A `host:port` target probes with a TCP SYN ping instead |
  | `http` | GET, OK if status < 500 |
  | `https` | GET with TLS verify |
  | `tcp` | TCP connect to `host:port` |
  | `ssh` | TCP connect to port 22 |
  | `prometheus` | GET `/metrics` |
  | `health` | GET `/health` |

- Checks run on a timer (`STATUS_CHECKER_INTERVAL`, 60s by default) and stream to the UI over WebSocket, no refresh. The sidebar footer keeps a running online/offline tally.

---

## 15. Export

**What:** Get your canvas out as a picture or as structured data.

**Use (toolbar):**
- **PNG**, a snapshot of the canvas, quality of your choice. Works in standalone too.
- **SVG**, vector export, keeps fonts, icons, and colors crisp. Same dialog as PNG.
- **Export (YAML)**, the whole canvas (nodes + links) as YAML you can re-import.
- **Markdown**, copies your device inventory as a Markdown table, handy for docs or a README.

---

## 16. Live View 🔒

**What:** A read-only, no-login snapshot of a canvas you can share on your LAN. Off by default.

**Use:**
1. Add `LIVEVIEW_KEY=your-secret-key` to `.env`, then `docker compose restart backend`.
2. Open `http://<your-homelab-ip>/view?key=your-secret-key`.

Pan and zoom only, no editing. Click a node with an IP and it opens in a new tab.

---

## 17. Gethomepage Widget 🔒

**What:** A tiny JSON stats endpoint for [gethomepage](https://gethomepage.dev)'s `customapi` widget. Off by default.

**Use:**
1. Add `HOMEPAGE_API_KEY=your-secret-key` to `.env`, restart the backend.
2. `GET /api/v1/stats/summary` with header `X-API-Key: your-secret-key` returns node counts, online/offline, pending, zigbee, and last scan time.

Widget snippet lives in the [README](./README.md#gethomepage-widget-read-only-stats).

---

## 18. MCP Server 🔒

**What:** A [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) server so an MCP client (Claude Code, Claude Desktop, Open WebUI…) can read and change your topology. Optional, runs as its own service.

**Use:**
1. Add the keys to `.env`:
   ```env
   MCP_API_KEY=mcp_sk_changeme      # AI client -> MCP server
   MCP_SERVICE_KEY=svc_changeme     # MCP server -> backend (internal only)
   # generate: python3 -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_hex(32))"
   ```
2. `docker compose up -d mcp` (listens on `:8001`). No Docker? `sudo bash scripts/lxc-mcp-install.sh`.
3. Point your client at `http://<your-homelab-ip>:8001/mcp` with header `X-API-Key: <your key>`.

The AI can list nodes/edges/canvas/zones/designs/inventory/scans, add/update/delete nodes, edges and zones, kick off scans, triage and edit inventory entries, and work a rack canvas — create racks, mount and move gear, patch cables. Keep port 8001 firewalled to your LAN. Full setup in the [README](./README.md#mcp-server-ai-integration-optional).

---

## 19. Settings & Shortcuts

**What:** App config and keyboard shortcuts.

**Use:**
- Sidebar → **Settings** for app-level config.
- **Search** to find nodes fast.
- Open the **Shortcuts** modal for the full key list (Save `Ctrl/Cmd+S`, undo/redo, and the rest).

---

## 20. Authentication (Local / OpenID Connect) 🔒

**What:** Homelable protects the app behind a login. Two exclusive modes, set once in `.env` with `AUTH_MODE`:
- **`local`** (default) — a single username + bcrypt-hashed password. Nothing changes for existing installs.
- **`oidc`** — sign in through your own identity provider (Authentik, Keycloak, Authelia, Google, …) via **Authorization Code + PKCE**. Good for SSO, per-user accounts at the IdP, MFA, and central account management.

**Use (OIDC):**
1. Register Homelable as a **confidential** client at your IdP and set the redirect URI to `https://<your-host>/api/v1/auth/oidc/callback`.
2. In `.env` set `AUTH_MODE=oidc` and the `OIDC_*` values (discovery URL, client id/secret, redirect URI, scopes), keep `CORS_ORIGINS` pinned to your browser origin, and give `SECRET_KEY` at least 32 bytes.
3. Restart the backend. The login screen now shows **Sign in with OpenID Connect**.

**How it protects you:** provider tokens are exchanged server-side and never touch the browser — Homelable issues its own short-lived, `__Host-`, HttpOnly, `SameSite=Lax` session cookie. Discovery metadata, issuer, audience, signature, expiry, nonce, state and PKCE are all validated; cookie-authenticated writes require a CSRF token and an allowed `Origin`; the status WebSocket authenticates from the cookie and validates `Origin`. Local Bearer auth and the MCP service key keep working unchanged. Full config, provider examples and troubleshooting: [docs/oidc-auth.md](./docs/oidc-auth.md).

> OIDC is Full-mode only — the no-backend standalone build has no login.
