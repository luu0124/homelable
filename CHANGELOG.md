## [3.4.2] - 2026-09-13

### Features

- Documentation can be exported. A document's viewer carries a **Download** button that writes the markdown it already holds, frontmatter included, and **Export all** builds a zip of the whole space server-side. The archive mirrors the sidebar: Library folders become directories with their own body as `index.md`, and device, node and design documents are placed by their link, each under a directory named for its kind. Colliding slugs are numbered rather than overwritten and every path segment is sanitised. (#437)
- The MCP server can edit a canvas' connection points and style its edges. `create_node`/`update_node` take the per-side handle counts and `show_port_numbers`; `create_edge` and a new `update_edge` take `source_handle`/`target_handle` plus the styling the UI already had — `animated`, `custom_color`, `path_style`, `line_style`, `width_mult`, `marker_start`, `marker_end`, `vlan_id` and `speed`. A new `list_edges` exposes the handles an edge sits on, which `get_canvas` slims away. Handle counts are clamped to 0..64 on every write path. (#436)
- The Getting Started tour walks through the Documentation section — the section itself, the template picker with wiki-links and history, and the device tree with its pivots — in three steps between the rack and styling ones. Backend-only, since a standalone build has nowhere to store a document. (#428)

### Fixes

- Renaming a service made the next scan append its own guess as a second entry on the same port, and the duplicate reached every canvas drawing the device. Service identity is now the port and protocol, not the name; a port-less service still keys on its name, because nothing else tells two of those apart. The client's `deviceFacts.keyOf` was keying the same service the old way, so a rename gave it a key the node had never seen and the corrected service was dropped from the canvas as hidden — the two now render the same identity. A merge collision keeps the survivor's curated name instead of letting a background scan's guess overwrite it. (#474, #478)
- `check_node` timed ping's whole subprocess, and since ping paces its two probes a second apart, every ping-checked device reported ~1000ms whatever its real latency. The RTT is read out of ping's own stdout across platforms and locales, the wall-clock kept only as a fallback for unparseable output. (#477)
- The `device_inventory` rebuild migration recreated the table with a `properties` column but left it out of the `INSERT...SELECT`, silently dropping every row's Zigbee/Z-Wave attributes. It now carries whatever columns the old table actually has. Thanks @NorthIsUp! (#471)
- A device parented in a canvas text annotation had that annotation's content written as its `zone_label`, and the generated document printed it as the zone. The parent walk now stops at `group`/`groupRect` only. (#464)
- One failed FTS5 probe — usually `database is locked`, from the boot reindex or a scanner thread holding a write — was cached as "this build has no FTS5" and cost the process every ranked search until a restart. A negative answer is now re-asked after a delay; a success is still final. (#463)
- The scanner's shared-IP collapse could pick an IEEE-less survivor and destroy the addresses the other rows held, after which the next scan no longer found the device and minted a fresh duplicate. It now refuses such a group, the way `reconcile_duplicates` already did. (#462)
- `POST /documents` with `kind='design'` accepted a nonexistent `design_id` with a 201 and stored a permanently orphaned row; `design_id` is now validated alongside `device_id` and `node_id` and answers 404. Thanks @slmingol! (#458)
- A row with a null `discovered_at` raised `TypeError` and aborted the merge transaction, and `dedupe_nodes_by_device` ran a full node-table scan per merged group instead of once per reconcile batch. Thanks @slmingol! (#454)
- An edge whose handle names a slot its node has no connection point for draws nothing and persists invisibly. `POST /edges` and `PATCH /edges/{id}` answer 422 for one, now that MCP can supply handles. MCP also carries the backend's error detail through to the client instead of a generic failure. (#436)
- Bumped js-yaml to 4.3.2 for GHSA-2883-xcg3-v3hh. (#436)

## [3.4.1] - 2026-09-07

### Features

- Duplicate Device Inventory rows can be merged. A **Merge** action in the inventory's select mode lets you pick the survivor — the only way to collapse rows that share no address at all, since a name is not an identity — and `reconcile_duplicates` now runs at the end of a Proxmox import and of a scan to collapse what a shared MAC proves (never a shared IP alone, never across two distinct IEEEs). Merging keeps everything: the survivor fills its gaps from the others, addresses, services, properties and sources union, and canvas nodes, rack mounts, documents and mesh links are re-pointed before the extra rows go. (#424)

### Fixes

- `dedupe_nodes_by_device` deleted duplicate nodes while `rack_devices.node_id` and `documents.node_id` still named them; SQLite runs with foreign keys off, so the declared `ON DELETE SET NULL` never fired. (#424)
- The scanner's duplicate collapse merges instead of deleting inventory rows outright, which lost their facts and orphaned whatever drew them. Its guard against removing a second approved row is unchanged. (#424)
- The merge dialog is wide enough to read an IEEE. The addresses are what the choice is made on, and a long name was clipped at the edge of the dialog; the address line now wraps instead of truncating, and the list grows with the viewport. (#424)

## [3.4.0] - 2026-09-07

### Features

- **Documentation** — a real document space for the homelab, beside the canvases. Markdown documents attached to a device, a node, a canvas, or standing on their own; a Library of folders, a Devices tree pivoted by zone, group, type, subnet, rack, vendor or tag, wiki-links between documents, full-text search (FTS5, with a `LIKE` fallback where SQLite ships without it), up to 50 revisions per document with a line diff and restore, backlinks under every body, tags, and a "needs attention" bucket driven by a per-document review interval. A device document is scaffolded once from the scan facts and then belongs to you — nothing rewrites it — with an explicit "device data changed" banner and a per-block regenerate when you want the new facts. The old `device_inventory.notes` are migrated in verbatim and left in place. (#418, #421)
- Documents are reachable from where you already are: a node's detail panel, a device's inventory modal, and the canvas search modal, which now finds documents too. Wiki-links are written from a picker instead of from memory. (#418, #421)
- The rack faceplate is a real, editable object, and the **Device Inventory owns it**: plate, U height, column span, colour and the port list — with each port placed by hand — are carried by the device, so it wears the same panel in every rack it is mounted in. Only placement, pinned status and label stay per canvas. A device's front panel can also be drawn and edited straight from its inventory row. (#405)
- A rack mount chooses when it shows its ports — `auto`, `always` or `hover` — and a cable can no longer end on a plate drawing no socket. (#407)
- Proxmox guests can be nested inside their host on the canvas instead of sitting beside it on virtual edges. Both entry points ask: the import modal and adding a Proxmox host from the Device Inventory. (#399)
- Homelable can be served under a subpath. One build-time knob, `VITE_BASE_PATH`, becomes Vite's `base` and is threaded through every hand-built URL, the status WebSocket, the OIDC login and callback, and both shipped nginx configs. Defaults to `/`, where nothing changes. (#412)
- The MCP server covers the rack canvas and the Device Inventory writes — 24 tools to 47. Racks, mounts, accessories, moves, faceplates and cables, plus create/edit/delete on inventory entries. (#414)
- The Homelable logo is in the brand icon picker, first in the catalog, for both node and service icons. (#411)

### Fixes

- The scanner and the status checker no longer send an HTTP `GET` to TCP/9100. A printer speaking JetDirect printed that request as a page of plaintext — once a minute, forever, for an approved node. LPD (515) and JetDirect (9100-9107) are now on the non-HTTP denylist. Trade-off: Prometheus Node Exporter on 9100 loses its status check and shows grey. (#406)
- A device declaring several IPs is matched on every one of them instead of coming back as a new pending row on each scan. Hiding it hides it at all of its addresses, and the deduplication collapses the duplicates an extra address had already spawned — never deleting a second approved row. (#416)
- A Proxmox import no longer overwrites one guest's inventory row with another's facts. Identity is now the synthetic per-guest ieee first, then NIC MAC, then IP — and the IP fallback skips rows already claimed by a guest, since a shared VIP, a re-used lease or a CNI bridge address describes several machines. A migrated or renamed guest keeps its row. (#420)
- Coming back to the canvas from Documentation keeps the pan and zoom you left it at, instead of remounting zoomed in at the origin. (#422)
- Switching back to a rack canvas restores its saved pan and zoom instead of shrinking the racks into a corner until a hard reload. (#409)
- The basic edge animation runs the same way whichever direction the nodes were dragged in; the dash direction was derived from the source and target's on-screen geometry. (#402)
- Login works under `podman-compose`. Quoted `AUTH_PASSWORD_HASH`, `SECRET_KEY` and `OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET` values arrive with their quotes attached, which Docker Compose strips and podman-compose does not; a matched pair of surrounding quotes is now unwrapped in the backend, so one `.env` works under either runtime. (#413)
- A zone or group description is kept on save. (#418)
- MCP node properties are keyed on `key`, not `name`, so they no longer collapse silently. (#414)
- Eight Dependabot advisories cleared in the frontend lockfile (`fast-uri`, `@humanfs/node`, `qs`, `nanoid`); all dev-only, `npm audit` reports zero. (#417)
- The npm and pip audit CI jobs retry a registry outage instead of failing the run. (#409)

### Docs

- README and FEATURES.md cover the Documentation section, and `docs/documentation.md` documents the tree, wiki-links, search, history, backlinks and the API. (#421)
- `.env.example` notes that quoting a secret is optional and works either way. (#413)

## [3.3.5] - 2026-08-21

### Features

- Deep-scan a single device from its inventory detail: the Services section gets a **Deep scan** button that sweeps the device over a port range you pick, prefilled with the full 1-65535 range and narrowable when you know where the service lives. The run is a normal Scan Run, so stop, progress and Scan History work as usual, and the fresh services are merged in — never replacing what you added by hand. (#363)

### Fixes

- A deep rescan of a slow host no longer comes back empty. The run hit its timeout and nmap discarded every port it had already found; the full range is now scanned in slices, a partial sweep is reported as partial instead of passed off as complete, and the timeout is a total budget between slices rather than an nmap flag. (#363)
- A scan no longer repaints the service icons you picked by hand: the fingerprint's guess overwrote your choice, and cleared it outright on a port no signature covers. Since 3.3.0 the inventory row is the only copy, so one scan changed the service on every canvas at once. (#363)
- A rescan finishing while you edit a device no longer throws the edit away, and it no longer tags every device it touches as network-discovered — a Proxmox guest, a rack mount or a hand-added host keeps its own source. A failed run is also recorded as `error`, the status Scan History filters and colours. (#363)
- A property with no value gets the full node width for its label instead of being truncated against empty space. (#362)
- A same-origin OIDC deployment behind a reverse proxy no longer answers 403 to every write. The CSRF check validated the browser's `Origin` against `CORS_ORIGINS` alone; the app's own origin, taken from `OIDC_REDIRECT_URI`, is accepted too, and startup warns when `CORS_ORIGINS` omits it. (#360)

## [3.3.4] - 2026-08-17

### Fixes

- A network scan no longer deletes the services you added by hand. The scanner replaced a device's whole service list with what it fingerprinted, so one scan wiped manual entries on every canvas at once and brought back the ones you had deleted. It merges now. (#347)
- A node whose services were all replaced under it no longer renders empty: when nothing a node's view names is left on the device, the device's own list is drawn instead of hiding everything. (#347)
- Properties added while running 3.3.0–3.3.2 survive the 3.3.3 upgrade. The view recovered from the pre-3.3.0 backup could not know about them, so they were hidden on every canvas; they are kept visible, and the per-canvas arrangement the backup does know is still restored. (#347)

## [3.3.3] - 2026-08-17

### Features

- Each node now keeps its own view of a device's services and properties: order and visibility are per node, so a service the scanner fingerprinted no longer appears on every canvas drawing that device, and a property added on one schematic stays there. The facts still live on the inventory row — hiding is per node, deleting is device-wide. Upgrades keep what each canvas showed today. (#357)

### Fixes

- The one-off view seed no longer re-opens the pre-upgrade backup on every boot: a node pointing at a deleted device kept matching the seed query and logged a recovery that recovered nothing. (#357)

## [3.3.2] - 2026-08-17

### Fixes

- Devices upgraded from 3.2.0 keep their ip, services, hostname, notes and hardware. The 3.3.0 migration aborted on timestamps SQLite returns as text, so nothing was carried across to the Device Inventory and every device read back blank. (#347, #348)
- A canvas saved while an earlier migration was stuck no longer loses its device facts: the migration now fills the blank inventory row that save created, instead of skipping the node and dropping the columns holding its only copy. (#347)

## [3.3.1] - 2026-08-17

### Fixes

- Approving a device no longer fails after an upgrade from 3.2.0: a node the 3.3.0 inventory backfill could not link kept the old device columns on `nodes`, and their NOT NULL constraint rejected every new node. (#352)

## [3.3.0] - 2026-08-15

### Features

- The Device Inventory is now the source of truth for device data: a node reads and edits its facts from its inventory row, and the device sheet is grouped by what a reader is after. (#339)
- Per-service host override, so a service can point at a host other than the node's own. (#338)
- A zone now parents the nodes dropped inside it. (#343)
- Node properties accept an empty value. (#345)
- Nodes can be given 0 connection points on top and bottom. (#336)
- KVM switch added as a device type. (#335)
- The sidebar version row links to the public changelog.

### Fixes

- Alignment guides show for nodes inside groups and containers. (#337)
- The status check interval is applied to the running scheduler. Thanks @JaG-v2. (#319)
- Bumped undici and ip-address to patch high severity advisories. (#342)

### Docs

- The pre-built GHCR images are documented in the install guide.

## [3.2.0] - 2026-08-10

### Features

- Rack canvas: a third design type, next to network and electrical, with racks, mounted devices and port-to-port patching. (#315)
- Declarative SVG faceplates picked from a visual catalog, including desktop NAS enclosures in 2, 4 and 5 bays. (#315)
- Rack gear is filed in the Device Inventory, and a mount can be picked from the rackable entries. (#315)
- Cables carry a type, colour, label and properties, printed on the canvas at the midpoint of the run. (#315)
- Mounted devices follow the status check of the logical node they match, and links can be imported from the logical canvas. (#315)
- Getting Started walkthrough covers the rack canvas. (#315)
- Show the logical view of a mounted device, and link a mount to any Device Inventory entry. (#323)

### Fixes

- Guard rack rows against cross-design saves and half-applied faceplates. (#315)
- A rack height edit no longer orphans its mounts; height and colour commit on blur, and a blanked field no longer shrinks the rack. (#315)
- Import links is idempotent, and stays usable after a run that matched nothing. (#315)
- Stop the device modal losing cables, status and inventory rows. (#315)
- Name rack inventory entries the way the Device Inventory does. (#315)
- Stamp the linked node's last-seen with an offset. (#323)
- Bump js-yaml to 4.3.1 for CVE-2026-59870. (#315)
- CI: stop the secret scan reporting pytest names as Lob keys. (#315)

### Docs

- Document the rack canvas for users. (#315)

- Proxmox VE import: pull hosts, VMs and LXC into inventory, with optional scheduled auto-sync and a manual re-sync button (connection config is now env-only). (#253, #259)
- Scheduled auto-sync for Zigbee & Z-Wave imports. (#270)
- Floor plan map background, LQI-based edge coloring, and Zigbee path highlighting. Thanks @pranjal-joshi. (#207)

- CHANGELOG with full release history. (#264)

## [2.6.1] - 2026-06-30

### Added

- Z-Wave nodes can be added/edited manually. A Z-Wave group (Controller / Router / End Device) is now in the Add/Edit node type selector, matching Zigbee. Mesh-radio nodes default to no status check.

### Fixed

- Standalone (frontend-only) multi-canvas (designs) support, originally merged in #244 after the 2.6.0 tag with no version bump.

## [2.6.0] - 2026-06-28

Device Pending is gone — replaced by **Device Inventory**: devices stay in an inventory, can be placed in multiple canvases, rescanned and updated. New **Z-Wave** section: scan, import and store Z-Wave devices like Zigbee.

### Added

- SVG export option in the canvas export modal, alongside PNG (#238).
- Deep-scan HTTP probe + Device Inventory: scans probe HTTP services and surface a per-device inventory (#222, closes #195).
- Z-Wave network scan via the MQTT bridge (#224).
- Inventory timestamps on nodes — nodes show when their inventory was last collected (#233).
- New nodes drop at the centre of the visible canvas instead of off-screen (#234).
- Expanded MAC OUI database: router, switch, AP, NAS and camera vendor prefixes (#220).

### Fixed

- Optional white background on export and working downloads in Firefox (#239, closes #165).
- MCP-created nodes/edges attach to the active design instead of floating (#237, closes #225).
- Stopping a scan interrupts the running nmap range immediately (#236, closes #218).
- Auto-layout orders Proxmox children by parent port number (#235).
- Copy-to-clipboard for Markdown works on non-secure HTTP origins (#219).

### Docs

- Documented the `SCANNER_HTTP_RANGES` port-spec format (#232).

## [2.5.1] - 2026-06-18

### Fixed

- Manually resized nodes — including VM/LXC nodes nested inside a Proxmox container — keep their size on reload instead of snapping back to content-fit.
- Node detail panel has a Size section for pixel-exact width/height; fields resync live when dragging a corner handle.
- Adding an LXC/VM under a non-container-mode Proxmox node no longer confines it to a tiny box — it stays a free, draggable node.

### Security

- Resolved high-severity npm audit advisories (`esbuild`, `form-data`, `vite` → 7.3.5).
- Bumped `python-multipart` to 0.0.31 (CVE-2026-53538/53539/53540).

## [2.5.0] - 2026-06-11

### Added

- Scan History modal with run duration, finished timestamp, and kind/status filters (#203).
- Container nesting: drag a node onto a container node to nest it; detach/re-parent via an editable container selector (#202).
- Editable node groups: add/remove members and edit the group description directly (#200).
- Multi-line edge labels (#199).
- Per-service status checks with offline colouring (#198).

### Fixed

- Reduce status flapping, add IPv6 ping, colour manually-added web services (#198).
- Keep non-HTTP services grey instead of red (#198).
- Idempotent WebSocket connection removal — release the slot on any error (#198).
- Persist group description with Ctrl+S, not only on blur (#200).

### Security

- Resolve Dependabot and code-scanning alerts; bump hono to 4.12.21+ (#197).
- Bump zeroconf to 0.149.12 for CVE-2026-48045 (#202).

## [2.4.0] - 2026-06-05

### Added

- Multiple designs (canvases): build and switch between separate diagrams, plus a new electrical-device node type (#177).
- Copy & paste nodes between designs (#189).
- Switch port numbers (up to 64 ports) plus a new fibre-optic link style (#172).
- Read-only Live View link in the header for sharing or wall displays (#185).
- Scans keep discovered MAC addresses when a device is approved (#178).
- Richer AI/MCP control: assistants can set the full set of node fields on create/update (#180).

### Changed

- Settings moved into a dedicated window for a cleaner sidebar (#188).
- "Hide IP" option now lives in Settings and is remembered between sessions (#189).
- Smoother link animations for flowing/snake styles (#187).

### Fixed

- "Show Port Numbers" now persists after reload (#191).
- The Save button works again (previously only Ctrl/Cmd+S) (#190).
- Zigbee re-import correctly brings back already-approved devices (#176).

### Security

- Dependency updates: zeroconf, qs, brace-expansion (#175, #182).

## [2.3.0] - 2026-05-31

### Added

- Full node schema over MCP: `create_node` / `update_node` expose the complete backend schema (`os`, `notes`, `mac`, `services`, `cpu_count`, `cpu_model`, `ram_gb`, `disk_gb`, `properties`, …); `get_canvas` round-trips the same fields (#174).
- MAC carried onto approved nodes from a scan (#168).
- Richer switch & edge modeling: switch port cap raised to 64, port numbers shown, new fibre edge type.

### Fixed

- Canvas includes the MAC property on the approved node so it shows immediately after approval (#168).
- Zigbee: revive orphaned approved devices on re-import instead of dropping them (#167).

### Security

- Bump `zeroconf` 0.131.0 → 0.149.7 for CVE fixes.

## [2.2.0] - 2026-05-29

### Added

- Laptop & mobile node types with theme-coherent styling (#166).
- Collapsible / expandable zones — `collapsed` is now a first-class `NodeData` field with edge rewiring and read-only liveview support (#158).
- LXC / bare-metal MCP install script `lxc-mcp-install.sh` with env-var overrides and repo-clone fallback; MCP image published to GHCR (#163).

## [2.1.1] - 2026-05-16

### Fixed

- LiveView: nest Docker container children under their host node; apply saved theme & custom style on load.

## [2.1.0] - 2026-05-16

### Added

- Draggable edge endpoints — reconnect either end of an edge to another node/handle; Proxmox containers gain snap points (#150).
- Docker containers can live inside VMs, Proxmox hosts or LXCs; parent auto-cleaned on type change (#153, #154).
- Group node side handles (top/right/bottom/left) for proper edge attachment (#152).
- Multiple IPs per node — paste several IPs separated by comma/space/newline, each clickable individually (#136).
- Zigbee device properties (IEEE, Vendor, Model, LQI) auto-populated on approve / re-import (#148).
- Homepage widget stats endpoint: new `/stats` API for gethomepage integration (closes #131, #149).
- Zone modal polish: centered opacity thumb, fixed font casing, full keyboard + ARIA support (#106).

### Security

- Dropped `passlib` in favour of direct `bcrypt`; status-check targets reject CLI-flag injection.

## [2.0.3] - 2026-05-13

### Changed

- Remove check method for Zigbee nodes.

## [2.0.2] - 2026-05-11

### Added

- Activated dashboardicons icons — brand-new icons selectable for nodes.

### Fixed

- Various modal fixes.

## [2.0.1] - 2026-05-11

### Added

- New Zigbee nodes available in the new/edit node modal.

## [2.0.0] - 2026-05-11

A major milestone: Zigbee2MQTT integration, a new pending-devices modal, text nodes and alignment guides.

### Added

- **Zigbee2MQTT integration** (thanks @pranjal-joshi): import a full Zigbee network map from Z2M as a background scan run; three new node types (Coordinator, Router, End Device); MQTT TLS with optional cert-verify skip; imported devices flow through the pending section with edge persistence.
- **New pending devices modal**: full-screen grid with cards, filters (IP / Zigbee / all), search, multi-select and bulk restore.
- **Text node type** for free-form annotations (#138).
- **Alignment guides + snap** while dragging nodes, built on `OnNodeDrag` (#139).
- **Per-node services toggle** to show/hide the services list on the node (thanks @findthelorax) (#107).
- Zigbee node types exposed in the Custom Style editor.

### Fixed

- Status checker: ms timeout for ping on macOS.
- Scan: default `check_method='ping'` for approved devices.
- Detail panel: handle non-Z timezone offsets in Last Seen.
- Groups: preserve children + size on edit; fix status WebSocket proxy.
- Pending: drop dangling `onNodeApproved` call; null-safe pending IP in SearchModal.
- Text node: persist text in `label` across reloads.

### Security

- Bump `fast-uri` (GHSA-q3j6-qgpj-74h6, GHSA-v39h-62p7-jpjc), `axios` ^1.15.2, `python-multipart`.
- Sanitize MQTT error messages to prevent credential leakage.

## [1.13.0] - 2026-05-03

### Added

- New **Firewall** node type under Add Node → Hardware, with distinct flame icon and red accent.
- Up to **48 bottom connection points** per node (slider, previously capped at 4); the node card grows wider as handles are added.

### Fixed

- Sidebar no longer freezes on Scan History after starting a scan.
- Delete confirmation respects Cancel — clicking Cancel keeps the modal open.

## [1.12.0] - 2026-04-24

### Added

- **Custom Style Editor**: per-node-type border/background/icon colour + opacity, per-edge colour/opacity/path/animation, default size per type, "Apply to existing nodes" and "Apply All to Canvas"; saved with the canvas.

### Changed

- Accessibility overhaul: consistent hover/focus borders, pointer cursors, keyboard navigation and Enter-to-apply across all modals (#108).
- IP address hint moved below the field; hover border colour toned down.

### Fixed

- Edge labels and the `+` waypoint handle stay on the routed path when waypoints are used (#94).
- Edge type select displays its full label (e.g. "IoT / Zigbee") instead of the raw value.

- **Docker Container** node type, nestable inside a Docker Host.
- Container mode now works for `docker_host`, `vm` and `lxc` (was Proxmox-only).

### Changed

- Service badges prioritise the service name; path truncates gracefully with a hover tooltip.
- Node resizer handle hit area enlarged (8px → 16px).

### Fixed

- Container mode not persisting after save/reload for non-Proxmox types.
- Container mode toggle having no visual effect on `docker_host` nodes.
- Status dot overlapping node content; consistent top-right placement.
- Missing icon/label gap in ProxmoxGroupNode container header.
- IP shown unmasked in ProxmoxGroupNode when hide-IP is enabled.

## [1.10.2] - 2026-04-21

### Added

- **Logout button** at the bottom of the sidebar (normal mode only).

### Fixed

- Pending Devices checkbox click no longer opens the approval modal.

### Added

- PNG export quality selector: Standard (1×), High (2×, default), Ultra (4×) (#89).
- Zone colour opacity sliders for text/border/background (#72).
- Optional service paths (e.g. `/admin`) appended to the clickable URL; port optional when a path is set (thanks @findthelorax) (#86).

### Fixed

- Bulk-approved nodes appear on canvas immediately (node IDs were null before DB flush).
- Proxmox container mode: visible properties now shown; custom icon now applied.
- `approve_device` returns 404 on missing device, 409 on double-approve (was 200).
- Node form no longer retains previous-session values when reopened in Add mode (#87).

- Automatic DB backup before schema migrations.
- Drag group from its title (#76); double-click a node to open its edit modal (#65).

### Fixed

- Node width no longer expands when long content overflows after a user resize.
- Proxmox nodes with `container_mode=false` restore their saved width on reload.
- Added curl to the backend image for the default healthcheck.

## [1.9.0] - 2026-04-09

### Added

- **Node properties system**: dynamic key/value/icon/visible properties replacing static hardware fields; visible ones shown on the node card; 20 Lucide icons; existing hardware data auto-migrated.
- **Edge waypoints**: click `+` to add, drag to move, double-click to remove; Bezier and Smooth step supported; persisted to backend.

### Changed

- Updated frontend npm dependencies; upgraded lucide-react; removed unused Proxmox/LXC install scripts.

## [1.8.2] - 2026-04-05

### Fixed

- Scan no longer starts before confirmation — "Scan Network" opens the config modal first.
- Windows ping compatibility (`-n 1 -w 1000` instead of Linux/macOS flags).

## [1.8.1] - 2026-04-05

### Added

- Search now includes pending devices in both the canvas search bar (Ctrl+F) and command palette (Ctrl+K).

### Fixed

### Changed

- **Scanner rewrite**: Phase 1 concurrent asyncio ping sweep (50 parallel pings) supplemented by `/proc/net/arp`; Phase 2 explicit `-sS`/`-sT` scan type with 60s host-timeout; resilient gather so one failing host no longer aborts the batch.

### Fixed

- Root logger StreamHandler so `app.*` logs are visible in Docker.
- CIDR validation on frontend and backend to prevent nmap argument injection.
- Pre-fetch canvas/hidden IPs before the scan loop (no N+1 queries); ARP table read off the event loop.
- Hide/ignore on a missing device returns 404 instead of 500.

## [1.7.1] - 2026-04-02

### Added

- Concurrent status checks via `asyncio.gather`, ending "maximum instances reached" spam.
- Improved IoT detection: two-phase nmap scan finds Shelly, Sonoff, Tapo devices with no open TCP ports.
- mDNS/Bonjour discovery (`_shelly._tcp`, `_esphomelib._tcp`, `_hap._tcp`, `_mqtt._tcp`, …) in parallel with nmap.
- 20+ IoT vendor MAC OUIs and CoAP ports added; IoT ranked above generic server.

### Fixed

- LXC/VM container mode: attaching to a Proxmox no longer creates a spurious edge; nesting is instant.
- Scheduler reliability: DetachedInstanceError, duplicate timestamps, shutdown handling, interval validation.

### Dependencies

- Added `zeroconf==0.131.0` for mDNS discovery.

## [1.7.0] - 2026-04-01

### Added

- **Lasso / box selection** — draw a rectangle to select multiple nodes; hold Space to pan; lasso/pan toggle in the controls.
- **Named groups** — group 2+ nodes into a resizable, renamable container with hide-border option and per-member navigation; persisted across save/reload.
- **Canvas search (Ctrl+F)** — filter nodes by label, IP, hostname, service; live match count; click to fly the camera.

### Fixed

- LXC install script: `apt-get update` runs verbosely with `--fix-missing` to handle stale Debian mirrors (fixes #36).
- Group parent/child relationships restore after save + reload.
- Removed React Flow's default grey background from container node types.

## [1.6.0] - 2026-03-30

### Added

- Scan deduplication — pending devices already on canvas or hidden are skipped on rescan; stale entries purged at scan start.
- Dedicated Settings panel (status-check interval moved out of the Scan Config modal).
- Live interval update without a server restart.
- Separate `/api/v1/settings` endpoint for the check interval.

### Fixed

- DEL key deletes selected nodes (previously Backspace only).
- Node deletion via shortcut/detail panel is undoable with Ctrl+Z.
- APScheduler guards against double-start and unguarded reschedule calls.

## [1.5.0] - 2026-03-29

### Added

- Inline service editing in the detail panel (pencil icon).
- Edge animation modes: None, Snake, Flow — fully persisted.
- Zone improvements: rename Rectangle → Zone, border-width selector, label position, text-size options.

### Fixed

- Edge animation not saved on new connections.
- Backend 422 when saving canvas with string animation values.
- Snake and Flow animations rendering identically in production.
- Login returned 500 instead of 401 when a bcrypt hash had `$` stripped by the shell (#21).
- Hardcoded CORS in docker-compose; clearer login error messages.

## [1.4.0] - 2026-03-28

### Added

- **Live View** — share a read-only view of the canvas on your network, no login required.
- Resizable nodes with persisted width/height.

### Fixed

- QEMU arm64 crash during Docker image build (`npm ci` illegal instruction on ARM64).
- nginx `reload-or-start` fallback broken on fresh LXC installs.

### CI

- ShellCheck + hadolint linting; Docker smoke tests and full-stack integration tests.

## [1.3.3] - 2026-03-27

### Fixed

- Scan failures on fresh Docker installs — `service_signatures.json` moved into the app package so the volume mount no longer overwrites it.
- Missing `ping` on Docker (`iputils-ping` added).
- Thread-safe signature-file loading; clear error if the file is missing.
- CORS restricted to the HTTP methods/headers the frontend uses.

## [1.3.2] - 2026-03-27

### Fixed

- Ping check method on fresh Docker installs — `iputils-ping` added to the backend image (`python:3.13-slim` ships without `ping`).

## [1.3.1] - 2026-03-27

### Added

- **YAML import/export** of the full canvas topology (nodes, edges, hardware specs, connections); import merges without overwriting; Dagre auto-layout on import; toolbar Import/Export buttons.

### Fixed

- ESLint 10 incompatibility from `npm audit fix` — pinned back to ESLint 9.x.

### Docs

- Split installation into `INSTALLATION.md`; documented the network scanner and dev mode.

## [1.3.0] - 2026-03-21

### Added

- Hardware specs per node (CPU model, cores, RAM, Disk) with "Show on node" and GB → TB formatting.
- `Docker Host` node type (Anchor icon), themed across all 5 themes.
- Group rectangle border style: Solid, Dashed, Dotted, Double, None.
- Categorized node-type selector (Hardware / Virtualization / IoT / Generic).

## [1.2.2] - 2026-03-17

### Added

- `scripts/update.sh` for fast in-place LXC updates (never touches `.env` or DB).

### Fixed

- `crypto.randomUUID` crash on HTTP/LXC installs — polyfill fallback.
- WebSocket failure on LXC (hardcoded port 8000 bypassing Nginx); added `/api/v1/status/ws/` upgrade block.
- Production build crash on LXC (test files in `tsconfig.app.json`).

### Security

- JWT no longer exposed in the WebSocket URL — sent as the first message after connect.

## [1.2.1] - 2026-03-16

### Added

- **MCP server** with HTTP/SSE transport for AI integration (Claude Code compatible); `parent_id` exposed in `update_node`; service-key auth for MCP → backend.

### Fixed

- "Add node" appeared broken with an empty Label — native validation doesn't render in Radix Dialog portals; now shows an inline error.
- SSE streaming crash; reduced `get_canvas` token usage.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-03-13

### Added

- Edge flow animation (per-edge toggle); Proxmox cluster edges animate bidirectionally.

- Shortcuts reference modal.

## [1.1.1] - 2026-03-11

### Added

- New logo and favicon; page title updated to Homelable.
- **Hide IPs** toggle in the sidebar — masks the last two octets.

### Fixed

- Auto-layout: peer nodes placed on the same row (no staircase); correct left-to-right ordering; child nodes always below their parent.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-03-10

### Added

- **Group rectangles** — decorative resizable zones with configurable label/font/position/colours and z-order; saved with the canvas.
- Add/remove services manually in the detail panel.
- All TCP services now clickable (HTTPS auto-detected for 443/8443; non-web ports excluded).

## [1.0.0] - 2026-03-09
