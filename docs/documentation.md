# Documentation

A markdown document per device, plus a free-form Library of pages and folders,
behind the **Documentation** entry in the left sidebar.

Before this, the only writing surface in Homelable was `device_inventory.notes`
— one `TEXT` column rendered as plain text. This replaces it with something that
can be structured, linked, searched and kept honest, without ever throwing the
old notes away.

---

## The model

Three tables. See `docs/database-model.md` for the columns.

| Table | What |
|---|---|
| `documents` | One markdown document. Either a Library `page`/`folder`, or a `device` / `node` / `design` document describing exactly one thing. |
| `document_revisions` | Prior bodies, pruned to the most recent 50 per document. |
| `documents_fts` | The FTS5 search index. Optional — see *Search* below. |

**A document attaches to the device, not to the node.** Since 3.3.0 a node draws
a device and the facts live on `device_inventory`, so one device reads the same
on every canvas it appears on.

**Every link is `SET NULL` and the title is denormalized.** Deleting a device or
a canvas never destroys what was written: the document survives as an orphan and
can be re-linked or filed into the Library. Foreign keys are off in this SQLite
setup, so the delete paths clear the columns by hand through
`app/services/doc_links.py::unlink_documents` — `nodes`, `scan` and `designs`
each call it before they delete.

**A folder is a document** (`kind='folder'`). That is what allows an empty
folder, and lets a folder carry an index body.

**One document per target.** Enforced twice: a 409 in the route, and partial
unique indexes created in `init_db` (`DOCUMENT_DDL` in `db/database.py` —
`create_all` cannot express a partial index or a virtual table).

---

## The generated header

`app/services/doc_template.py` scaffolds a device document from the live facts:
addresses, hardware, one section per fingerprinted service, rack and zone
placement, canvas neighbours, custom properties. Old `notes` are appended
verbatim under `## Notes` behind an HTML-comment provenance marker.

**It is generated once and then belongs to the user.** Nothing rewrites a body
that already exists. Two things keep it from going stale silently:

- `facts_snapshot` records the facts as they read at generation time, so the UI
  can say *the device has changed* and list what.
- `GET /api/v1/documents/blocks?block=…&device_id=…` renders any single block on
  demand — that is what the editor's `/device`, `/services`, `/rack`… commands
  insert. Regeneration is always one keystroke away, and never automatic.

A section whose data is empty is still emitted, with an italic prompt: the
document is a checklist of what has not been written yet. Sections that are
structural rather than descriptive — the rack position of an unracked device —
are dropped instead.

Service URLs in a document follow `frontend/src/utils/serviceUrl.ts`, including
its non-HTTP port denylist, so a link in a document is the link the canvas
offers.

---

## The tree

Two roots, with different natures.

**Devices** is a pivot, rebuilt client-side in
`frontend/src/documentation/tree.ts` from data the app already holds. Grouping
by zone, group, type, physical/virtual, subnet, canvas, rack, vendor, discovery
source, status, tag, or flat A–Z is instant and needs no server round trip.

- Zone and group come from walking `parent_id` up to the nearest `groupRect` /
  `group` node.
- Subnet prefers a configured scanner range, else the address's own /24. A
  device with several IPs appears under each subnet it reaches.
- Physical / Virtual / Host is derived: `vm`/`lxc`/`docker_container` are
  virtual, `proxmox`/`docker_host` and anything drawn as a container are hosts.
- Canvas answers "on the loaded canvas or not" — the app only holds one at a
  time.

**Library** is the real folder tree, ordered by `sort_order` then title.

Badges: `·` no document, `○` only the generated header, `●` written, `⚠` the
device changed since, `⏰` past its `review_every`.

---

## Editing

Markdown source on the left, live preview on the right. Source rather than a
rich editor on purpose: the body is exported verbatim, so what is typed is what
the file holds.

**Saving is explicit** — Ctrl/Cmd+S or the Save button — matching the canvas
rule that nothing persists on a timer. An unsaved body is mirrored to
`localStorage` under `homelable_docdraft:<id>` on every keystroke and cleared on
save. On reopening, a draft taken against the version being opened is *offered*;
a draft taken against an older version is discarded, because replaying it would
revert a change made elsewhere.

`/` at the start of a line opens the insert menu: the generated blocks above,
plus table, checklist, callout, wiki-link and date.

`[[` opens the link picker, anywhere in the line: filter by title, pick, and the
finished link is written for you. It offers documents only — a device with no
document is not a link target yet — and it addresses a document by title, or by
`[[doc:<id>]]` when another document shares that title, since a bare link
resolves by title and an ambiguous one would silently pick the first. The second
bracket is held back while the menu is open (opening it moves focus, and a
keystroke landing mid-move belongs to neither box) and given back if you cancel,
so what you typed survives either way.

---

## Links between documents

`[[device:nas-01]]`, `[[doc:vlan-plan]]`, `[[node:<id>]]`, or a bare
`[[VLAN plan]]`; `[[…|label]]` sets the text. A device resolves by id or label,
a document by id, slug, then title, all case-insensitively. An unresolved link
renders red and offers to create the document.

Parsed as a text pass over the rendered children (`wikilinks.ts` +
`markdown/WikiText.tsx`) rather than as a remark plugin, so the file stays
ordinary markdown for anything else that reads it.

**Raw HTML is deliberately not rendered** — `rehype-raw` is absent — so a
document cannot inject markup and no sanitiser is needed.

### Backlinks

Every document lists what points at it, under **Linked from**, with the line the
link was written on and the label it was written as.

The inversion is done **server-side** (`services/doc_backlinks.py`,
`GET /documents/{id}/backlinks`), because the browser holds no bodies but the
open one: `GET /documents` is metadata-only so the tree can badge without
downloading the space. That service mirrors the resolution rules in
`wikilinks.ts` — same prefixes, same id → slug → title fallback, same
case-insensitivity — the way the generator's `service_url` mirrors
`utils/serviceUrl.ts`. Change one and change the other;
`test_doc_backlinks.py` pins the rules.

Repeated links from the same document collapse into one entry with a count, and
a document never backlinks itself. The inventory is only loaded when some body
actually carries a `[[device:…]]`.

---

## History

Every explicit save that changes the body snapshots the previous one, capped at
`REVISION_LIMIT` (50) per document; so do restore, regenerate, scaffold and the
notes migration, each recording why.

The clock-arrow button in the header opens the history rail: what each version
was (Saved, Regenerated, Restored, Migrated from notes…), when, and how big.
Selecting one replaces the body with that version — same title, same chips, same
rail — and **Changes** turns it into a line diff against the current body, with
long unchanged runs collapsed. **Restore** brings it back, snapshotting the body
it replaces first, so a restore is itself undoable.

A revision's body is fetched only when it is opened: the list carries a size, not
the text, so fifty versions cost one small request.

The diff is a plain LCS over lines (`documentation/diff.ts`), after the common
head and tail are trimmed — no diff library, and a pathological pair of long,
wholly different bodies degrades to "replaced wholesale" instead of building a
250k-cell matrix.

---

## Search

`GET /api/v1/documents/search?q=` over title, tags and body.

The same index answers the canvas' own search modal (Ctrl/Cmd+K), which lists
matching documents under the nodes and pending devices; picking one switches to
Documentation and opens it. The request is debounced and skipped below two
characters, and a failure there costs only the document rows — the node and
device halves filter lists already in memory.

FTS5 is **not** assumed: the SQLite shipped in the LXC and Docker images may be
built without it, the same reason `database.py` avoids JSON1. `doc_search.py`
probes once and falls back to `LIKE`, and the response says which engine
answered (`fts5` or `like`) so the UI can drop snippet highlighting. The index is
maintained from Python on every write — no triggers — and `_reindex_documents_fts`
catches up on boot after an upgrade or a restored backup.

User input is never FTS5 syntax: `build_match_query` quotes every term, so an
IP or a stray quote is data.

## Migrating the old notes

Non-destructive and repeatable.

1. `GET /api/v1/documents/coverage` reports `notes_unmigrated`.
2. A banner offers to migrate.
3. `POST /api/v1/documents/scaffold {"only_with_notes": true}` creates one
   document per device, old notes appended verbatim, with a `migrate` revision.
4. **`device_inventory.notes` is left exactly as it was.** It is still the
   column the HACS integration, the YAML export, the MCP tools and the canvas
   search read. Deprecating it is a separate decision.

## API

| Method | Path |
|---|---|
| `GET` | `/api/v1/documents` — metadata only, filterable by `kind`, `parent_id`, `device_id`, `tag` |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/documents/{id}` |
| `POST` | `/api/v1/documents` |
| `PATCH` | `/api/v1/documents/{id}` |
| `DELETE` | `/api/v1/documents/{id}` — a folder takes its subtree |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/documents/{id}/revisions`, `/revisions/{rev_id}` |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/documents/{id}/backlinks` — the documents linking here |
| `POST` | `/api/v1/documents/{id}/revisions/{rev_id}/restore` |
| `POST` | `/api/v1/documents/{id}/regenerate` — erase the body and scaffold it again |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/documents/search?q=&limit=` |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/documents/blocks?block=&device_id=` |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/documents/coverage` |
| `POST` | `/api/v1/documents/scaffold` |

## MCP tools

An AI client reads and writes documents through the MCP server
(`mcp/app/documents.py`). Every tool is a call to the API above — the server
never touches the database itself.

| Tool | What |
|---|---|
| `search_documentation` | Full-text search, one snippet per hit. The entry point. |
| `list_documentation` | Summaries, filterable by `kind` / `parent_id` / `device_id` / `tag`. Never a body. |
| `read_document` | One document in full. |
| `list_document_revisions`, `read_document_revision` | The history, and the body one revision holds. |
| `document_backlinks` | What links here. |
| `create_document` | A new document, from a body or a template. |
| `update_document` | An edit. The full replacement body, not a patch. |
| `restore_document_revision` | Put an earlier body back. |

Resources: `homelable://documents` (summaries) and
`homelable://documents/<id>` (one document, body included).

**Every AI edit is historized.** `update_document` sends
`revision_reason: "mcp"` whatever the client asks for — `DocumentUpdate` only
accepts `edit`, `mcp` or `import`, so no caller can dress an edit up as a
restore either. The replaced body is snapshotted like any other edit and the
rail says *Saved by an AI client*; restoring it is one click, and that restore is
itself undoable. There is no delete tool: destroying documentation stays a human
action.

---

## Standalone mode

Documents are **full-mode only**. Standalone has no backend to store or search
them, and the same reasoning as ADR-001 applies: the section is hidden in the
sidebar and explains itself if reached directly, rather than being polyfilled
into `localStorage` with no search and no history.

---

## Not built yet

Export/import of the tree as `.md` files, a print/handbook view, an aggregated
open-tasks view, and image upload inside a document (would reuse
`api/routes/media.py`, full-mode only) — the planned second lot.
