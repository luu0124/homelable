/**
 * Declarative Getting Started steps.
 *
 * `anchor` is a CSS selector for the element to ring/spotlight (undefined → the
 * overlay lights any open modal, or centers the card). `action` is a key resolved
 * against the walkthrough actions context on step enter (opens a modal, injects
 * demo data, selects nodes, …). `mode: 'full'` marks a backend-only step that is
 * filtered out of the standalone/public build. `link` renders a link in the card
 * (used for the closing "questions?" step).
