 * canvas loads — so a save cannot tell "I edited this" from "the row moved on
 * since I loaded it" without a baseline. `changedFactFields` compares against
 * the values the canvas was given, and the save sends the answer as
 * `changed_facts` so the backend writes the edit rather than the snapshot.
 *
 * `status` / `last_seen` / `response_time_ms` are deliberately absent: the
 * status checker owns reachability, a canvas never edits it.

 *
 * A service is identified by its port and protocol, never by its name — the

 * label: the scanner guesses it, the user corrects it, and keying on it made a
 * rename look like a different service. `listArrangedForNode` would then drop
 * the entry the node drew and append the renamed one hidden, so correcting a
 * service in the Device Inventory made it vanish from every canvas (issue #468).

 * A service with no port keeps the three-part form, name included: nothing else
 * tells two of those apart.
