"""Documents — the markdown documentation space.

A document is either a page or a folder in the Library tree, or it describes one
thing elsewhere in the app: a Device Inventory row, a piece of canvas furniture
(a zone, a group), or a whole canvas. The tree the user navigates is *not* stored
here: device documents are pivoted client-side by zone, subnet, type and so on,
because every one of those groupings is derivable from data the frontend already
holds and re-pivoting must be instant.

The generated header is written once, at creation; `GET /blocks` hands the editor
a freshly generated section on request, and `facts_snapshot` is what lets the UI
say the device has moved on since the document was written. The one flow that
rewrites a body is `POST /{id}/update-from-device`, and only through the guided
three-way merge of `app.services.doc_reconcile`: nothing is overwritten unless
the device simply moved on (automatic) or the user resolved the conflict
explicitly. `baseline_body` records the body that was *generated* at the last
sync — never the merged one — so a value the user deliberately kept is surfaced
again when the device moves on once more.
