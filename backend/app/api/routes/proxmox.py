"""FastAPI router for Proxmox VE import + auto-sync config.

Fetches hosts/VMs/LXC from the Proxmox REST API and upserts them into the
pending inventory (same review→approve flow as scans and mesh imports).

Credentials: the API token comes from the request body when provided, else
falls back to the server-configured env token (``settings.proxmox_token_*``) —
only for the configured host and port, and never with TLS verification off
when the server keeps it on.
The token is never persisted by the app and never returned by any endpoint.
